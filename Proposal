# Group Project Proposal
The main goal of this group project is to create a user friendly website. Our user will be anyone that is willing to participate to write as short as one sentence to be a part of building a complete story. This game is easy to understand and contribute, it provides a platform where people can simply join and communicate. Potentially, markdown and python will be used in the process and our proposed schedule are described in more details down below.


Specifically, HTML is supported in Visual Studio Code followed [VS HTML Language](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html) specification.

## proposed schedule
- [Content](#lists)
- [Code](#code)
- [Test and Iterations](#test)

## Content
    Specific contents including website design, user interface, and demo of how to use the website will be included in this section of our project. For example, width, height, initial scale, inimum-scale. Deliver date is undetermined for the moment.

## Code
    The functions used for the website will be written in Python and supported with flask. Goal is to use our creativity combined with class materials to complete the task. 


## Test and Iterations
    In this phase we will be sending invitations to friends and peers as test run. Iterations will be made accordingly based on our received feedbacks.
